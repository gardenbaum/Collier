# AI Agent Instructions

## Overview

Collier is a cross-platform desktop application that provides a graphical user interface for Beads. It is built with Tauri v2, React, and TypeScript, following the opinionated patterns described in this file and `docs/developer/`.

## Core Rules

### New Sessions

- Read @docs/tasks.md for task management
- Review `docs/developer/architecture-guide.md` for high-level patterns
- Check `docs/developer/README.md` for the full documentation index
- Check git status and project structure

### Development Practices

**CRITICAL:** Follow these strictly:

0. **Use bun only**: This project uses `bun`, NOT `npm`. Always use `bun install`, `bun run`, etc.
1. **Read Before Editing**: Always read files first to understand context
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use patterns from this file and `docs/developer`
3. **Senior Architect Mindset**: Consider performance, maintainability, testability
4. **Batch Operations**: Use multiple tool calls in single responses
5. **Match Code Style**: Follow existing formatting and patterns
6. **Test Coverage**: Write comprehensive tests for business logic
7. **Quality Gates**: Run `bun run check:all` after significant changes
8. **No Dev Server**: Ask user to run and report back
9. **No Unsolicited Commits**: Only when explicitly requested
10. **Documentation**: Update relevant `docs/developer/` files for new patterns
11. **Removing files**: Always use `rm -f`

**CRITICAL:** Use Tauri v2 docs only. Always use modern Rust formatting: `format!("{variable}")`

## Architecture Patterns (CRITICAL)

### State Management Onion

```
useState (component) → Zustand (global UI) → TanStack Query (persistent data)
```

**Decision**: Is data needed across components? → Does it persist between sessions?

### Performance Pattern (CRITICAL)

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Selector syntax - only re-renders when specific value changes
const leftSidebarVisible = useUIStore(state => state.leftSidebarVisible)

// ❌ BAD: Destructuring causes render cascades (caught by ast-grep)
const { leftSidebarVisible } = useUIStore()

// ✅ GOOD: Use getState() in callbacks for current state
const handleAction = () => {
  const { data, setData } = useStore.getState()
  setData(newData)
}
```

### Static Analysis

- **React Compiler**: Handles memoization automatically - no manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` needed
- **ast-grep**: Enforces architecture patterns (e.g., no Zustand destructuring). See `docs/developer/static-analysis.md`
- **Knip/jscpd**: Periodic cleanup tools. Use `/cleanup` command (Claude Code)

### Event-Driven Bridge

- **Rust → React**: `app.emit("event-name", data)` → `listen("event-name", handler)`
- **React → Rust**: Use typed commands from `@/lib/tauri-bindings` (tauri-specta)
- **Commands**: All actions flow through centralized command system

### Tauri Command Pattern (tauri-specta)

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Type-safe commands with Result handling
import { commands } from '@/lib/tauri-bindings'

const result = await commands.loadPreferences()
if (result.status === 'ok') {
  console.log(result.data.theme)
}

// ❌ BAD: String-based invoke (no type safety)
const prefs = await invoke('load_preferences')
```

**Adding commands**: See `docs/developer/tauri-commands.md`

### Internationalization (i18n)

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Use useTranslation hook in React components
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'

function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation()
  return <h1>{t('myFeature.title')}</h1>
}

// ✅ GOOD: Non-React contexts - bind for many calls, or use directly
import i18n from '@/i18n/config'
const t = i18n.t.bind(i18n)  // Bind once for many translations
i18n.t('key')                 // Or call directly for occasional use
```

- **Translations**: All strings in `/locales/*.json`
- **RTL Support**: Use CSS logical properties (`text-start` not `text-left`)
- **Adding strings**: See `docs/developer/i18n-patterns.md`

### Documentation & Versions

- **Context7 First**: Always use Context7 for framework docs before WebSearch
- **Version Requirements**: Tauri v2.x, shadcn/ui v4.x, Tailwind v4.x, React 19.x, Zustand v5.x, Vite v7.x, Vitest v4.x

## Developer Documentation

For complete patterns and detailed guidance, see `docs/developer/README.md`.

Key documents:

- `architecture-guide.md` - Mental models, security, anti-patterns
- `state-management.md` - State onion, getState() pattern details
- `tauri-commands.md` - Adding new Rust commands
- `static-analysis.md` - All linting tools and quality gates

## Claude Code Skills & Agents

These are specific to Claude Code but documented here for context.

### Skills

- `/init` - One-time template initialization (includes package manager selection)
- `/check` - Check work against architecture, run `bun run check:all`, suggest commit message
- `/cleanup` - Run static analysis (knip, jscpd, check:all), get structured recommendations
- `/change-package-manager <bun|pnpm|npm>` - Switch package manager across all config, scripts, docs, CI, and AI instructions

### Agents

Task-focused agents that leverage separate context for focused work:

- `cleanup-analyzer` - Analyze static analysis output (used by `/cleanup`)
- `userguide-reviewer` - Review user guide against actual system features

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:

   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```

5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**

- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.
